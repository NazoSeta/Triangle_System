# Triangle_System

The purpose of this program is to print some amount of triangle based on the number of interations given. With each interation the amount of triangles will be multiplied by three (3^interations many triangles). Also, the triangles will be in each others as you will see when running the program.

This project let us understand the following:

- Using multidimensional array
- Recursion
- Nested Loops
- Keeping track of your program
